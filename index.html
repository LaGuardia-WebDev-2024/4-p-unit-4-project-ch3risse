          follows an older man, Lee Everett, who gains the ally that comes in
          the form of a young girl, Clementine. They gain allies througout the
          game, and certain aspects are decision based. (You can pick the

          AJ! You have to play the game to know why. ;))

            "Resident Evil" isnt <i>technically</i> a horror game, but I have to
            say, it didnt really scare me when playing. It was one of those
            games that make you feel uneasy because you can feel the presence of
            the antagonist, and the game is pretty dim. It's in the middleground
            of horror and disturbing. Uncomfy. Anyway, it was created in Japan
            in 1996 by Capcom; The game follows Chris and Jill, (you thought it
            was gonna be leon) who attempt to escape a virus that was manmade
            from the Umbrella Corportation; they hide in a zombie infested
            mansion, evading the monsters while also uncovering the secrets of
            the corportation! (leon's in resident evil 2. womp womp. )

          "Doki Doki Literature Club" was absolutely viral when it first
          released, and I could definitely see why! I watched some gameplays
          before, and the art is truly beautiful!
          <br />

          DDLC was created in 2017 by Team Salvato, and was released on Steam of
          December 22nd of that year. It blew up because of the gameplays that
          famous Youtubers did following its release, and its fanbase grew
          exponentially. I hold in my heart, since it is one of the games I grew
          up watching gameplays on; I loved the music, the character design, and
          how 'dating sim horror' felt like such a fresh topic for me. Although,
          the game has elements that made me uncomfy, which is natural for
          anyone. So, despite it being a horror game, I always steered clear of
          the incedibly disturbing facotrs hiding beneath the 'dating sim'
          facade. The game follows the nameless protagonist, you, as you follow
          a close friend Sayori (pink hair and a bow) to her literature club. To
          be brief, one of the girls takes a heavy liking to you (they all do)
          and her feelings make her become physcially violent, to the point of
          taking over the game to seriously harm the other girls. Spooky! <br />

          Little Misfortune was a game created by Killmonday Games, released in
